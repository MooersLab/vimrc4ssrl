# vimrc4ssrl

Blaine's dot vimrc file that worked on the Structural Molecular Biology computer system at SSRL (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource) in February 2020.

This computer system is Centos 7 (`cat /etc/os-release`).

The vim had version 7.4.

You will have to install vundle in `~/.vim` first for the plugins to be installed in the subfolder `~/.vim/bundle`.
Otherwise comment out the lines that call the plugins.

This file differs from the one for OSCER.
